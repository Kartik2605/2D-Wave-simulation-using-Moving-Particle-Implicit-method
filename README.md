# 2D Wave simulation using Moving Particle Implicit method
Understanding and accurately predicting the dynamics of water surfaces are
essential for designing structures, optimizing coastal defences, and ensuring the
safety of maritime activities. In this project, we delve into the realm of numeri-
cal methods for fluid simulation, focusing on the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit
(MPS) methodâ€”a mesh-free approach renowned for its versatility in capturing
complex fluid behaviours.
The MPS method is chosen for its ability to model free surfaces and fluid inter-
actions without the constraints of a fixed grid. It employs particles to represent
the fluid, enabling the simulation of dynamic free surfaces and fluid flows with
greater flexibility than traditional grid-based methods.
