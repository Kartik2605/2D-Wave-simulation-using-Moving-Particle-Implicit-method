# 2D Wave simulation using Moving Particle Implicit method

## Introduction :
Understanding and accurately predicting the dynamics of water surfaces are essential for designing structures, optimizing coastal defences, and ensuring the safety of maritime activities. In this project, I delved into the realm of numerical methods for fluid simulation, focusing on the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) methodâ€”a mesh-free approach renowned for its versatility in capturing complex fluid behaviours. The MPS method is chosen for its ability to model free surfaces and fluid inter- actions without the constraints of a fixed grid. It employs particles to represent the fluid, enabling the simulation of dynamic free surfaces and fluid flows with greater flexibility than traditional grid-based methods.
The report file gives a detail overiew of the model implementation and using it for simulating different 2D waveforms. It is validated for a 2D solitary wave form against the standard benchmark case found in the literature.
